# Go TODO API

A simple RESTful TODO list API written in Go using SQLite and Gorilla Mux.

## Features

- Create todos (title + task) for specific users
- Update existing todos (change title and mark as completed)
- Delete tasks
- List all todo titles for a user

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or newer
- SQLite (VSCode extension)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anitamalina/GOTODO.git
    cd GOTODO
    ```

2. **Create the SQLite database**

    Ensure you have a database file at 
    `./db/development.db`

    In VSCode open search and write: 
    ```text
    >SQLite: Open Database
    ```

    and select the database `./db/development.db`
    
    `SQLite Explorer` will open in left lower corner, where the database can be refreshed and tables be "played" to see it visually.

    You might have to run the queries in `./db/sql.sql`
    
    In VSCode open search and write: 
    ```text
    >SQLite: Run Query
    ```

3. **Run the server**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    You should see:
    ```text
    Server started on port 8080
    ```
